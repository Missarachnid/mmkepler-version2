This is version 3.0. I rewored the site to learn next.js

***  Why I decided to use Next.js
**** I was doing a huge tutorial for Next.js, but all of the sudden an important part of the project was no longer supporting MongoDB for the database! So I decided to use Next for my website redo since it is image heavy and I wanted to see how server side rendering handled it. This has been a huge headache. Nearly all of my website was removed from being part of the tab order, so I had to add that manually. Even though I used Next.js own Image tag, when doing a Lighthouse scan I was yelled at for not using them. And also yelled at for not adding specific images sizes, even when I did. While Next.js seemed great for making a web store like in the tutorial, it is not that great for a small website. Lesson learned.
